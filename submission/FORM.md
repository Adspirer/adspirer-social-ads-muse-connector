## Anything else

Official Adspirer company repository for this connector: https://github.com/Adspirer/adspirer-social-ads-muse-connector. This is one of Adspirer's focused connectors, covering Meta Ads (Facebook and Instagram) and TikTok Ads at `https://mcp.adspirer.com/social-ads`. Our main connector, covering every platform, is submitted separately from https://github.com/Adspirer/adspirer-muse-connector. Every platform has a read-only router enforced by the server, write routers ask for confirmation on the server before running, and new campaigns are always created paused. Per-tool Read, Write and Sensitive-write classes are in submission/TOOLS.md. We can arrange reviewer access privately through support@adspirer.com.

## Before sending

Re-check the live tool list against TOOLS.md, confirm contact details and plan or region requirements, and read the current portal terms. Do not mark end-to-end tests as passed until they run inside Muse.
